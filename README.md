# UOP_SE_Y2S1-PUSL2002_WEB_DEVELOPMENT_PLATFORMS

## Coursework

The Road Development Authority (RDA) of Sri Lanka along with the Sri Lankan Police and Insurance Companies are planning to launch a web site to track the traffic accidents, where the drivers can report accidents and RDA/Police can support.

- Anyone who owns a vehicle or drives a vehicle can register to the system using the vehicle registration numbers and insurance details.
- When there is an accident, a driver can report the accident through the web site; with some supporting photos and video clips.
- RDA staff, Police, and relevant insurance companies can view all the reported incidents (such as shown in Figure 1), validate by looking at the uploaded photo(s) and take necessary actions.
- RDA and Police can evaluate the evidence and approve drivers’ reports and send help to the reported locations shown on a map.
- Insurance companies can communicate by sending direct messages to the drivers whose reports got approved.
- The Police can see the accidents as different graphs; such as percentages of bike, car, bus, etc. accidents or accidents by locations.

Create a web application using PHP or ASP.NET C# with MySQL/Oracle/SQL Server database to demonstrate the above scenario.
Functional Requirements

- There should be an “Web Master” who can create accounts for the Police, RDA and insurance staff.
- Drivers can sign up for free. Registered drivers can input data (including images), delete and update his/her own incidents.
- Police and RDA can see the reported incidents as a list and on a map, click to reveal more details on a popup dialog box (similar interface like Figure 1). S/he can then approve/refuse them and set a flag based on importance such as red flag for serious.
- Police can also see the graphs; analysis of types of accidents, locations they occur, fluctuations of accidents now and then.
- Insurance staff can see the approved reports. Different flagged reports are displayed with different icons on a map. More information can be seen when such an icon is clicked. They can also directly communicate with the drivers whose reports are approved.
- General public can see the accidents on a map but without the details of drivers. The public is also eligible for view of graphs.

### Preparation and Analysis

- Explain how you plan/analyze the project and distribute workload between yourselves using a storyboard or a user story. Show each member’s contribution by writing initials next to the idea/sketch/component.
